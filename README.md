Get wireless signal and show it on RGB led strip
Tested and working

You will need to add you SSID and password
Pin on ESP is now set to D1
Change NUM_LEDS (how many leds you have)

Do not connect RBG strip while EsP is connected to USB port I dod not test it that way it could draw to nuch current.

Im using one Li-ion cell to power ESP and strip...
